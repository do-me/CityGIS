# CityGIS
## A splash page template for GIS afterwork meetups. 

Orignally created for #MilanoGIS
* Homepage: https://geo.rocks/milanogis/
* LinkedIn Event: https://www.linkedin.com/events/milanogis6864457413907509248/about/

Feel free to use the template for your own local GIS meetups! :) 

Just make sure to reference: 

* the html template from html5up and 
* in case the background image from NASA

as you can see in the current footer. 

Also I would appreciate a reference to me and a message (find me on [my blog](https://geo.rocks/)) as I would like to create a meta page of all existing #<City>GIS meetups.

If you need help for deployment let me know. The recommended way (if you don't have a homepage yourself yet) is just to use netlify. 
  
1. Clone/download this repository and unzip 
2. Change the source code to your needs
3. Create an account on netlify 
4. Go to **sites**
5. Drag'n'drop the folder with your `index.html` in the respective field
6. Change the name of the site to <Yourcity>GIS.netlify.app. 
7. Done!
